# MATLAB PROJECT - Finding height of lenses matrix 

## Decription
This project was created as part of the "Numerical Methods in Optics" course. The aim of the project is to find the height of the lens array using various numerical methods, 
such as plane wave propagation, phase unwrapping, circle detection, etc. Final description is in pdf file. 

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2019 or later.
- Presence of image data in the `data/` folder. Due to copyright reasons, the photos were not placed in the repository.
